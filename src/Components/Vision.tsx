        Message from our student interns: We are a group of passionate and
        talented students led by inspiring mentors. We hope to be a voice
        amongst fellow students and our neighborhood on the dangers of
        pollution, environmental hazards and possible remedies to forestall
        these re-occurring phenomena caused by both nature and man-made events.
        In 2 to 5 years, we hope to send a message to the global community on
        climate change and the way forward.
