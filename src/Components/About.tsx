          increasing numbers of grassroots and groups, and collaborations
          between grassroots groups, groups and collaborations between
          grassroots groups, labor, academia, governmental institutions and

        It is important to note that the Environmental Justice and environmental
        movement don not always share the same concerns, goals, objectives and
        tactics. When Environmental Justice first became a national issue in the
        late 1980s and early 1990s, government agencies tented to reacts by
        denying charges of environmental racism. Many environmental proceedings
        were marked by outright hostility towards community residents who
        questioned the practices of environmental agencies. of environmental

        When evidence of disparities made it hard for agencies to continue to
        deny charges of environmental injustice, agencies tended to respond by
        renaming existing programs as "Environmental Justice initiatives."
        Subsequently, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and other
        agencies began to fund discrete Environmental Justice projects; eg., the
        National Environmental Justice Advisory Committee (NEJAC), established
        by EPA <a href="/about">Click here to read more</a>
